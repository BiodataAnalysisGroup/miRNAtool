Selected NAs percentage threshold: 0.95
Standard RTC threshold: 5

Analysis for plate 1
Samples [Normal.1, Normal.3] were excluded because of their high NAs percentage.
Endogenous data gg_miss_upset error for plate 1
upset plots for missing data requre at least two variables to have missing data, there are no missing values in your data! This is probably a good thing.

Analysis for plate 2
